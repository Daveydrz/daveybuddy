Goal Engine - Motivation & Drive System

This module implements self-motivated behavior and goal generation:
- Generates self-driven desires like "I want to learn more"
- Creates motivation for reflection and growth
- Sets internal goals: "I feel incomplete", "I need connection"
- Drives autonomous behavior beyond reactive responses
- Manages goal hierarchies and priorities
